How to build
------------

To start a build for all supported targets simply call

**Mac/Linux: ./build.sh**

**Windows: build.bat** (must be run as administrator when building for Tizen). By default the build script tries to use Visual Studio 2017 to use Visual Studio 2015 call **build.bat -v 2015**

This will build all targets and first time intall CMake and Tizen SDK.

Or call **build.bat -h** or **./build.sh -h** to display the usage of the script and it will list all available targets.

To build just a specific target call command with argument **-t <TARGET>** (available targets can be shown calling with **-h** argument).

How to develop
--------------

If you developing the SDK, you can use the generated project files to work with.

They are located under **build/jenkins/build/[target]** after calling the **build.sh** or **build.bat**.


Folderstructure
---------------

* **build** - Contains scripts for automated project setup, building and creating of the final exstracted library
* **build/cmake** - Contains the cmake files for the project
* **build/jenkins** - Contains the scripts and working directories for the automated builds
* **export** - Target folder for the automated export of the GA lib
* **precompiled** - Contains precompiled libraries for the different targets if you don't want to comile them yourself
* **source** - Contains the complete source code for the project including the dependencies
* **tests** - Contains tests for testing the functionality in the GA SDK, to run tests run **tests/run_tests_osx.py** (mac only)

Lib Dependencies
----------------

* **crossguid** (*as source*) - Cross platform library to generate a Guid.
* **cryptoC++** (*as source*) - collection of functions and classes for cryptography related tasks.
* **curl** (*as binary*) - library used to make HTTP requests.
* **jsonCpp** (*as source*) - lightweight C++ library for manipulating JSON values including serialization and deserialization.
* **openssl** (*as binary*) - used by **curl** to make HTTPS requests.
* **plog** (*as source*) - library used for logging.
* **SQLite** (*as source*) - SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

*as source* means the dependency will be compiled with the project itself, *as binary* means the dependency is prebuild and will be linked to the project

Preperation before usage of the SDK
-----------------------------------

* Include the following directories in your C++ project's include paths:
  * **source/gameanalytics**

* In your C++ project, link to the following libraries:
  * All libraries in **source/dependencies/curl/lib/[target]**
  * All libraries in **source/dependencies/openssl/1.0.2h/libs/[target]**
  * Produced library from build script found in **export/[target]-static/Release/**


Usage of the SDK
----------------

Remember to include the GameAnalytics header file wherever you are using the SDK:

``` c++
 #include "GameAnalytics.h"
```

### Configuration

Example:

``` c++
 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::setEnabledInfoLog(true);
 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::setEnabledVerboseLog(true);

 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::configureBuild("0.10");

 {
     std::vector<std::string> list;
     list.push_back("gems");
     list.push_back("gold");
     gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::configureAvailableResourceCurrencies(list);
 }
 {
     std::vector<std::string> list;
     list.push_back("boost");
     list.push_back("lives");
     gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::configureAvailableResourceItemTypes(list);
 }
 {
     std::vector<std::string> list;
     list.push_back("ninja");
     list.push_back("samurai");
     gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::configureAvailableCustomDimensions01(list);
 }
 {
     std::vector<std::string> list;
     list.push_back("whale");
     list.push_back("dolphin");
     gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::configureAvailableCustomDimensions02(list);
 }
 {
     std::vector<std::string> list;
     list.push_back("horde");
     list.push_back("alliance");
     gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::configureAvailableCustomDimensions03(list);
 }
```

### Initialization

Example:

``` c++
 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::initialize("<your game key>", "<your secret key");
```

### Send events

Example:

``` c++
 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::addDesignEvent("testEvent");
 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::addBusinessEvent("USD", 100, "boost", "super_boost", "shop");
 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::addResourceEvent(gameanalytics::Source, "gems", 10, "lives", "extra_life");
 gameanalytics::GameAnalytics::addProgressionEvent(gameanalytics::Start, "progression01", "progression02");
```
